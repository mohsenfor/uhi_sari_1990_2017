# uhi_sari_1990_2017
comparison between uhi and related indexes of Sari(Iran) for 1990 and 2017
This Jupyter Notebook project investigates urban heat island (UHI) effects and land surface temperature (LST) dynamics in Sari, Iran, between 1990 and 2017. Using geospatial data derived from a Google Earth Engine (GEE) project, including LST raster files and their attributed CSV data, along with UHI intensity, land cover classifications, and city boundaries, the analysis compares key metrics such as mean and median LST, UHI intensity, hotspot area, and Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation across the two time periods. The project calculates a city-wide reference temperature, identifies neighborhoods experiencing transitions between hotspot and non-hotspot status, and assesses land cover changes (croplands, waterbodies, woodlands, built-up areas, brownfields, and asphalt) within these transitioning areas to understand the influence of land cover on UHI development.
